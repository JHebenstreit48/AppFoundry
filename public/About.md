  testing, and distribution.

<div class="Note">
  <strong>Current focus:</strong> information architecture, build pipeline
  consistency, and performance optimization.  
  The sites are moving toward deeper category granularity, consistent
  subpage structure, and lazy-loaded routing for faster, more predictable
  navigation.

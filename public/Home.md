  AppFoundry is a personal knowledge base for <span class="emphasis">mobile app</span> and
  <span class="emphasis">mobile game</span> development. It consolidates notes, patterns, and
  workflows across native (iOS/Android) and cross-platform stacks (React Native, Flutter, Unity),
  focused on practical build/release pipelines, store submission, testing, performance, and
  real-world developer ergonomics.

  This project shares a common structure with several others:

- <span class="projectName">DevScriptStax:</span> <span class="projectDescrip">(web development)</span>

<div class="Note">
  NOTE: All four projects—AppFoundry, PixelProse, DevScriptStax, and NetNotes—are currently undergoing
  a major refactor of navigation and routes. The primary focus is on granularizing categories and
  subpages, restructuring content for consistency, and implementing lazy-loaded routing across the
  sites.  

  While this structural work is the main priority, new notes and topic pages are also being added in
  parallel, though content expansion is not the central focus at this stage.
